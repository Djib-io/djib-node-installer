# Djib Node Installator

this repo is installation script for Djib nodes. djib is a decentralized web3 storage network; a headless blockchain enabling enterprise object storage on any network. 
Every node in djib chain, stakes [DJIB Token](https://solscan.io/token/3Hi27r9kUtSmiPYtpRJNYCCGTGosnqC5Dhz812TrjpaY), provides network, storage and computation power, thus receives djib tokens emitted every day based on its contribution. More than [70% percent of DJIB token](https://solscan.io/account/9sQtK2RtEScuZuRkre9bMXDeKg8ZZ8L16YiV9kLr2U9x)  will be emitted over 70 years to node. 
there are two type of nodes in djib network **relay** and **Core**. relay and core node offer simillar services except the fact that relay nodes donot store data. this instruction automatically instals relay version. 
it is expected to have core nodes launched by Q4- 2023, however timing can change. 
every relay node can be promoted to Core by lauch of Core.  

## Become a node 
in order to become a node you need to have a server up and running, Your server needs to have (at least) 4G of memory, it also requires to have (at least) 2 CPUs (4 recommended). to learn more about prices and provides you can check out [this website](https://search.djuno.io/search?q=server)
